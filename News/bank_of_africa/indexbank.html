              During September 13-23, Bank of Africa Group, a multinational
              pan-African banking conglomerate with banking operations in
              eighteen African countries, held its annual event – Directors
              Meeting. Used to be very important from many angles, this event
              gathered about 150 senior level people from all related countries
              and representative offices. Needless to say that discussions of
              most vital business aspects and strategic plans surrounded the
              primary goal of this gathering – paving the way to brighter and
              more prosperous future of the Bank of Africa Group.
            </p>

            <p>
              Simbrella was cordially invited to participate at the event, and
              our company was given the stage during plenary session day, on
              September 18th, for to present the most innovative solutions
              dedicated to digital scoring and micro-lending business areas of
              the financial services industry. Our company proudly presented its
              latest developments in the field, such as AI/ML-driven scoring,
              loan management platform, DaaS (Data as a Service) platform. Also,
              Simbrella demonstrated based on real case studies the very
              importance of building the financial partnerships between banks
              and mobile wallets as the only ones that could efficiently drive
              the future of serving financial needs of the immense unbanked
              population.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our company firmly believes that this partnership with Bank of
              Africa Group will provide strong benefits to all related parties
              and will boost the development of the whole eco-system whereby
