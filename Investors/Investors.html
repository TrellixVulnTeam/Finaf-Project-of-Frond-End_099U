                <h2>Our story</h2>
                <p>
                  When Simbrella pioneered its Air Time Credit service business
                  back in 2005 lending a subscriber an airtime on the premise
                  that they will pay back with a bit of premium, our company
                  inadvertently stepped into Fintech in its pure definition –
                  providing financial services (lending) via technological
                  solution, in this case using telecom carrier as a channel and
                  ecosystem.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Important to mention that the target audience was prepaid
                  customer base, those who could not qualify to talk on credit
                  by the MNO. Basically, Simbrella, via leveraging its scoring
                  algorithm, its superb IT and integration teams widened the
                  eligibility window for telecom provider, thus increasing the
                  usage and bringing in additional income from interest sharing.
                  Effectively Simbrella became a credit enabler, making its
                  earnings from the bottom of telecom subscribers’ pyramid.

                <p>
                  As a first project Simbrella’s successfully implemented micro
                  lending service in a ‘top 10’ Nigerian bank, relying solely on
                  previous, sometimes very limited payments history using
                  dynamic scoring algorithm that was tested and perfected in
                  telecom operations. Machine learning based black box algorithm
                  processes swathes of data and enables split-of-the-second
                  scoring and lending decision – agility quite unseen in slow
                  paced banking environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And today, in a relatively short period, Simbrella’s current
                  Fintech pipeline of projects scores 6 live operations and up
                  to 5 more implementations to be launched within the next 6
                  months.
